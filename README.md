# Python Dice Roller

This was made for myself for rolling dnd dice. It supports many different types of rolls, and supports a fairly simple syntax:
[amount of dice][letter 'd'][type of dice][modifier type (+-/*)][modifier][various other effects]

There is a built in help function, history function, decent error handling, etc.

I am planning on writing a gtk gui eventually, probably soon-ish.
